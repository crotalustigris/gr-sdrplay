Version by John Moore - added ability to control external reference out, on the RSP2, from the GUI
It works for my project. 

But... I foolishly made my changes on the main branch. Oops.


--- old notes from when I grabbed this project from git ---
Project is under review - do not use yet!

If using a PYBOMBS prefix setup, do not forget to source the env vars with setup_env.sh!

<pre>
cd gr-sdrplay
mkdir build && cmake .. && make
sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
</pre>
